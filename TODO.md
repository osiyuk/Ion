# My plan for doing things

Basic pieces of compiler
- Arena allocator
- Hash functions
- Hash table (hash map)
- Parser error recovery
- Line number (filename) information in errors
- Visual structure of errors
- Thread safe lexer
- Resolve ast
- Type checking
- Compound literals
- Easy compiler profiling
- Unnamed structs/unions/enums
- Support bitfields?

What to do next?
- Watch bitwise videos, until codegen
